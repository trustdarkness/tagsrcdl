// If you like content, especially made by independent creators who
// most of them don't make much and don't have nice things like health
// care, you should buy it.  An ethical discussion of intellectual 
// property and ownership are outside the scope of this comment.
// But there is a technical discussion -- the modern Internet has
// all sorts of tricks for publishers to allow you to see content
// but try to prevent you from doing other things with that content.
// but, if you can see it, if you can hear it, you can save it.
// anything that prevents you from that is usually some kind of 
// hack on top of modern "dynamic" "web apps" and what not -- 
// software designed to abstract much of the complexity of how things
// work away from the user, so the Internet is more like a TV and
// less like a build your own crystal radio like we used to buy
// at radio shack in the 80s.  The point is, the underlying 
// fundamentals haven't changed, if you can figure out how they're
// letting you see / hear / access the content, you can use that 
// to pause and save for later, incorporate into a fair-use 
// composition, analyze it for subliminial messages.  Anything you 
// like.  As it once was, and as it can be again, if you learn and
